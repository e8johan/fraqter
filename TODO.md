TODO list for Fraqter
=====================

- Implement panning
- Have a templated value type, i.e. double, that can be replaced with an arbitrary precision implementation
- Create colouring control, i.e. mapping the value of the fractal part (range 0 to 1) to a colour range
- Implement FComplex editor widget
- Move rendering to render thread - and make it possible to cancel current render job if needed
